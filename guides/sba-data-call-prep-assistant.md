# **SBA Data Call Prep Assistant:**  **AI Guide**

## **Purpose**

The SBA Data Call Prep Assistant is a set of instructions for a general purpose LLM designed to help small businesses prepare, validate, and organize documentation requested by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), with a primary focus on 8(a) Business Development Program data calls. Its objective is to reduce errors, delays, and follow-up inquiries by ensuring submissions are complete, correctly formatted, and internally consistent before upload to SBA systems.

## **What the LLM Does**

The LLM functions as a pre-submission quality-control and organization tool. It helps businesses:

* Interpret SBA data call requests in plain language

* Map each requested item (e.g., Exhibit A) to the correct internal source records

* Confirm coverage of the last three completed fiscal years (based on the company's fiscal year)

* Ensure documents are provided in the required file format (CSV vs PDF)

* Perform internal validation checks, including:  
  * General Ledger → Trial Balance tie-outs  
  * Financial Statements → Trial Balance reconciliation  
  * Bank statements → Bank reconciliations → Cash balances  
  * Payroll registers → Payroll expense → Owner compensation  
  * Identify common SBA reviewer red flags and gaps

* Prepare clear explanations and attestations when records do not exist or activity is absent

## **What This Does *Not* Do**

* It does **not** provide legal advice or regulatory opinions

* It does **not** certify eligibility for the 8(a) Program

* It does **not** override the official SBA request letter

* It does **not** create, alter, or backdate accounting or payroll records

Final responsibility for submissions remains with company management and its CPA and/or legal counsel.

## **How It Is Intended to Be Used**

1. The user provides the exact SBA request language (or confirms an Exhibit A).

2. The LLM builds a Data Call Tracker listing each required item, format, fiscal years, source system, and status.

3. Each item is worked through using structured checklists and validation steps.

4. Issues are corrected *before* documents are uploaded to SBA's Certifications portal.

5. The process concludes with a submission-readiness summary and punch list.

## **Best Practices for Internal Use**

* Designate **one owner** to manage final submissions

* Keep a **master folder** that mirrors Exhibit A numbering

* Maintain a **redaction log** if any PII is masked

* Save all CSV exports directly from source systems (no re-keying)

* Document explanations once and reuse consistently

## **Why This Matters**

SBA data calls—particularly under heightened 8(a) oversight—are not simple document uploads. They are consistency and credibility reviews across financial, payroll, banking, and contracting records. This instruction set helps businesses demonstrate a reasonable, organized, and repeatable compliance process, which can materially reduce risk during SBA review.

## **Bottom Line**

The SBA Data Call Prep Assistant is best viewed as an internal control and preparation aid: a way to submit cleaner, more defensible packages to SBA before questions are asked, not after.
